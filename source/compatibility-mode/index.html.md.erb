# Use with old frameworks or colours

You can configure GOV.UK Frontend to look like our old ('legacy') frameworks, GOV.UK Elements, GOV.UK Template and GOV.UK Frontend Toolkit.

You cannot use the following features if you installed GOV.UK Frontend from `dist`. [Install with node package manager](/installing_with_npm) instead.

If you use these features, your service will not meet [level AA of WCAG 2.1](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/understanding-wca) because your users will not be able to change the font size.

## 'Compatibility mode'

Turn on 'compatibility mode' if you want to use GOV.UK Frontend components and an old framework together in a service.

GOV.UK Frontend will:

- use the old colour palette
- use the old GOV.UK font from GOV.UK Template
- override some of the CSS in the legacy frameworks
- no longer use `rem` for font sizes

## Turn on 'compatibility mode'

Add one or more of the following lines to your project's Sass file, above `@import "govuk-frontend/govuk/all"`:

- `$govuk-compatibility-govukelements: true;` if you're using GOV.UK Elements
- `$govuk-compatibility-govuktemplate: true;` if you're using GOV.UK Template
- `$govuk-compatibility-govukfrontendtoolkit: true;` if you're using GOV.UK Frontend toolkit

You can leave out a variable to turn off compatibility mode for that framework.

## Turn off 'compatibility mode'

Remove the following lines from your project's Sass file:

- `$govuk-compatibility-govukelements: true;`
- `$govuk-compatibility-govuktemplate: true;`
- `$govuk-compatibility-govukfrontendtoolkit: true;`

## Use the old colour palette

If you are not using any of the legacy frameworks, you can still configure GOV.UK Frontend to use the old colour palette.

Add the following variable to your project's Sass file, above `@import "govuk-frontend/govuk/all"`:

```scss
$govuk-use-legacy-palette: true;
```
